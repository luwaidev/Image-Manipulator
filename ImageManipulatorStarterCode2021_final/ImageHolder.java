/**
 * <p>ImageHolder contains two images - a full size image and a display image.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Most cameras take photos that are at least 12 "Megapixels," which usually
 * means images that are 4000x3000 pixels or larger. Computer screens are usually 
 * somewhere between "1080p" (1920x1080) and "4K / UHD" (3840x2160). As well as the
 * computer displays being significantly smaller to start with, we also need room for
 * the user interface, the Windows/Mac task bar, etc. So, this class serves to manage
 * one image to actually alter and manipulate, and another to display.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If the image is smaller than the max displayable image size (set by constants in the Background)
 * then the display image and the full image will be the same, but will be processed in the same 
 * manner as if they were different.</p>
 * 
 * <p>When you apply an effect to the image, you must complete three steps as demonstrated in
 * the bluify example:</p>
 * 
 * <ol><li>Call the image manipulation method on getBufferedImage() from this class:<br>
 * <code>Processor.blueify(image.getBufferedImage());</code></li>
 * <li> Call the redraw method, to recalculate scale and update the displayed image:<br>
 * <code>image.redraw();</code>
 * <li> Update the info displayed in the World (optional - this might vary depending on your UI)<br>
 * <code>openFile.update (image.getDetails ());</li></ol>
