     * <h3>Mr. Cohen's Text Centering Algorithm</h3>
     * 
     * <p>Get the Width of a String, if it was printed out using the drawString command in a particular
     * Font.</p>
     * <p>There is a performance cost to this, although it is more significant on the Gallery, and 
     * especially on the Gallery when browsed on a mobile device. It is appropriate to call this in the 
     * constructor, and in most cases it is ideal NOT to call it from an act method, especially
     * every act.</p>
     * 
     * <p>In cases where values are pre-determined, it may be ideal to cache the values (save them) so 
     * you don't have to run this repeatedly on the same text. If you do this in the World constructor,
     * there is no performance cost while running.</p>
     * 
     * <h3>Performance & Compatibility:</h3>
     * <ul>
     *  <li> Locally, performance should be sufficient on any moderate computer (average call 0.1-0.2ms on my laptop)</li>
     *  <li> To be compatible with Greenfoot Gallery, removed use of getAwtImage() and replaced with getColorAt() on a GreenfootImage</li>
     *  <li> On Gallery, performance is about 10x slower than locally (4ms on Gallery via Computer). For reference, an act() should be
     *       less than 16.6ms to maintain 60 frames/acts per second. </li>
     *  <li> HUGE performance drop on Gallery via Mobile devices - not sure why, going to ignore for now. (Average update duration 34ms, more
     *       than 2 optimal acts)</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * @param font the GreenFoot.Font which is being used to draw text
     * @param text the actual text to be drawn
     * @return int  the width of the String text as draw in Font font, in pixels.
     * 
     * @since June 2021
     * @version December 2021 - Even more Efficiency Improvement - sub 0.06ms per update on setSpeed(100)!
